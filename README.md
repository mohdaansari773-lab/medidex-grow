# MediVault Reference

Bilkul. Lovable ke liye main prompt ko implementation-focused rakhunga—UI ke saath proper database schema, admin/update system, medicine search, classification, pronunciation, Explain, ADME, Drug Memory, quizzes aur future scalability.



Important: Lovable ko ek hi baar mein “all medicines in India” generate karne ko mat bolo. Pehle architecture + verified starter dataset banao, phir database/import pipeline se expand karo.



Build a production-quality, scalable, mobile-first web application called:



MEDIVAULT INDIA



Tagline:

"Medicine • Pharmacology • Learning • Reference"



Use a clean, professional medical-reference design. This is NOT a simple landing page and NOT a static medicine list. Build the actual application architecture, database schema, reusable components, navigation, search, learning modules and admin-ready system.



The application must be designed so that the medicine database can grow from a small verified starter dataset to thousands of medicines without rebuilding the application.



==================================================



1. PRODUCT PURPOSE
